# About our framework

Wi-Fi tools keep getting more and more accessible to beginners, and the Ehtools Framework is a framework of serious penetration tools that can be explored easily from within it. This powerful and simple tool can be used for everything from installing new add-ons to grabbing a WPA handshake in a matter of seconds. Plus, it's easy to install, set up, and utilize.

# To install our ehtools PRO

> cd /root/ehtools

> chmod +x install.sh

> ./install.sh 

> ehtools

# To activate our ehtools PRO

This key you can buy on our ehtools website for one dollar! This key is used to activate ehtools PRO enter it in the input field of the activation key in the file install.sh and then you can install ehtools and use it only for educational purposes!

    WARNING: The key works only one week then it changes!
    You need to have time to enter it before it is updated!

> ./install.sh

    Enter your ehtools activation key!
    Or buy it on ehtools site!
    (activation_key)> 
    
Also, we do not recommend to change the source code of ehtools because it is very complex and you can mess up something and disrupt the framework!

![Ehtools Installer 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/56846875-29365b00-68dd-11e9-9646-9e40a763789f.png)


# Attacking frameworks

Most new Wi-Fi hacking tools rely on many of the same underlying attacks, and scripts that automate using other more familiar tools like Aireplay-ng are often referred to as frameworks. These frameworks try to organize tools in smart or useful ways to take them a step beyond the functionality or usability of the original program.

An excellent example of this are programs that integrate scanning tools like Airodump-ng, attacks like WPS Pixie-Dust, and cracking tools like Aircrack-ng to create an easy-to-follow attack chain for beginners. Doing this makes the process of using these tools easier to remember and can be seen as sort of a guided tour. While each of these attacks is possible without the hand-holding, the result can be faster or more convenient than trying to do so yourself.

An example of this we've covered is the Airgeddonframework, a wireless attack framework that does useful things like automating the target selection process and eliminating the time a user spends copying and pasting information between programs. This saves valuable time for even experienced pentesters but has the disadvantage of preventing beginners from understanding what's happening "under the hood" of the attack. While this is true, most of these frameworks are fast, efficient, and dead simple to use, enabling even beginners to take on and disable an entire network.

# UX/UI Impruvements for begginers

The Ehtools Framework starts by merely typing the letter ehtools or eht into a terminal window, then it asks for the name of your network interfaces after the first run. It uses the names you supply to connect to the tools needed to execute any attacks you select. Aside from that initial input, the majority of the possible attacks can be performed merely by choosing the option number from the menu. This means you can grab a network handshake or download a new hacking tool like Pupy by just selecting from one of the menu options.

# Use basic networking tools

To begin, we can access data about the network we're currently connected to, as well as any network interfaces, from the main menu. Here, we can find local information by just typing l to pull up local IP information, as seen below.

This allows us to do things like scan the network for other devices. This part of Ehtools Framework gives us better visibility on a network and situational awareness of what devices are around us. The various information can be broken down as follows:

> (ehtools)> if
 
    INFO: Runs ifconfig and gives the names and information 
    about all network devices.

> (ehtools)> 1

    INFO: Enable wlan0.
    (d1 disables it)

> (ehtools)> 2

    INFO: Enable wlan0mon.
    (d2 disables it)

> (ehtools)> 3    
   
    INFO: Randomize or set the MAC address to a specific value.

> (ehtools)> 7     

    INFO: View the public IP address your computer 
    is leaving on sites you visit.

> (ehtools)> 19    

    INFO: Look up the physical address of a given 
    IP address to determine it's relative location.

> (ehtools)> scan   

    INFO: Start an ARP scan on the network 
    to discover nearby devices.

> (ehtools)> start  
      
    INFO: Start monitor mode on the wireless network adapter.

> (ehtools)> stop

    INFO: Stop wireless monitor mode on the network adapter.

# Install new tools

![Tools Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/56701380-84aef000-6707-11e9-9dc2-32e0286e08d7.png)

Part of the fun of Ehtools is how easy it is to add new tools to our arsenal. To demonstrate this, let's download Pupy, a Python-based RAT designed to take control of other computers on the network. We can select option 9 to access the list of tools in Ehtools Framework.

    INFO: Our framework has more than 100 packages in
    ehtools archive (on server this archive: 2.3 Tb)!

From the next menu, the tools are broken down into major categories, with options for managing the installation of scripts. The options presented are:

> 1) Wi-Fi tools (tools for attacking wireless networks).

    INFO: Wi-Fi options this is tools for attacking wireless
    networks and network databases.

> 2) Remote access (tools for getting remote access to other devices and remotely managing them).

    INFO: Remote access means tools for getting access to 
    other devices and remotely managing them.
    
> 3) Information gathering (collecting intelligence on people or website).

    INFO: Information gathering tools, tools for collecting
    intelligence on peaple or website.
    
> 4) Website tools (tools for exploiting or attacking sites).

    INFO: Website tools, tools for exploiting or attacking
    sites and network databases.
   
> 5) Other (a miscellaneous collection of other hacking tools)

    INFO: Other tools this is collection of miscellaneous
    hacking tools.

You can also manage your installed tools by accessing option 6. To download Pupy, we'll go to option 2, which is remote access. Here, we will see a list of different tools for remote access, and we can select option 3 for Pupy.

# Use quick access (only ehtools PRO)

    INFO: Quick access, this is when you run ehtools
    and for example ehtools -r to remove ehtools!
    
Run it to open quick access menu:

> ehtools -o

Run it to update ehtools:

> ehtools -u

Run it to remove ehtools:

> ehtools -r

Run it to make handshake:

> ehtools -h

Run it to open WPS menu:

> ehtools -w

    INFO: For this shortcuts you will not need
    enter your ehtools password!

# Why our framework? 

> More than 58 tools for pentesting installed by default

    INFO: More than 58 options installed by default you
    can find in ehtools, this is tools such as MetaSploit
    WireShark and other tools!

> Password protection and config encryption

    INFO: In version 2.1.6 we added pasword protection,
    we added it for users who think that his/her friend or
    parents will turn into ehtools and will remove or destroy
    it. Only for this people we create password protection
    for ehtools framework :)

> Easy in learning and this is the best framework for begginers

    INFO: Ehtools framework's GUI is very simple for begginers,
    you can start attack on the local network by choosing an
    option from main menu. It is very simple, is not it?

> UX/UI impruvements for begginers

    INFO: It uses the names you supply to connect to the tools 
    needed to execute any attacks you select! Aside from that 
    initial input, the majority of the possible attacks can be performed 
    merely by choosing the option number from the menu. This means you can 
    grab a network handshake or download a new hacking tool like Pupy by just 
    selecting from one of the menu options!

> More than 100 tools you can install from ehtools or ehtoolslite

    INFO: Our framework has more than 100 packages in
    ehtools archive (on server this archive: 2.3 Tb)!

# System requirements 

> Full root access and access to /root folder

    INFO: All ehtools files and folders will copy to /root,
    /bin and /etc system folders, for copy ehtools data to
    your system needed root access!

> Bourne-again shell and Gnome-terminal shell

    INFO: Bourne-again shell and Gnome-terminal shell needed
    for ehtools GUI and also without Gnome-terminall shell 
    modules such as (eht1, eht2 and etc.) will not work!

> Good internet connection for server support (only ehtools PRO)

    INFO: The server support for ehtools PRO is one of system 
    requirements, it is needed for collect information about 
    ehtools crashes and it is also needed for check product 
    status such as (you bought ehtools/you did not buy ehtools)
