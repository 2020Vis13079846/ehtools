# Attacking frameworks

Most new Wi-Fi hacking tools rely on many of the same underlying attacks, and scripts that automate using other more familiar tools like Aireplay-ng are often referred to as frameworks. These frameworks try to organize tools in smart or useful ways to take them a step beyond the functionality or usability of the original program.

An excellent example of this are programs that integrate scanning tools like Airodump-ng, attacks like WPS Pixie-Dust, and cracking tools like Aircrack-ng to create an easy-to-follow attack chain for beginners. Doing this makes the process of using these tools easier to remember and can be seen as sort of a guided tour. While each of these attacks is possible without the hand-holding, the result can be faster or more convenient than trying to do so yourself.

An example of this we've covered is the Airgeddonframework, a wireless attack framework that does useful things like automating the target selection process and eliminating the time a user spends copying and pasting information between programs. This saves valuable time for even experienced pentesters but has the disadvantage of preventing beginners from understanding what's happening "under the hood" of the attack. While this is true, most of these frameworks are fast, efficient, and dead simple to use, enabling even beginners to take on and disable an entire network.

# UX/UI impruvements for beginners

The Ehtools Framework starts by merely typing the letter ehtools or eht into a terminal window, then it asks for the name of your network interfaces after the first run. It uses the names you supply to connect to the tools needed to execute any attacks you select. Aside from that initial input, the majority of the possible attacks can be performed merely by choosing the option number from the menu. This means you can grab a network handshake or download a new hacking tool like Pupy by just selecting from one of the menu options.

# Use basic networking tools

To begin, we can access data about the network we're currently connected to, as well as any network interfaces, from the main menu. Here, we can find local information by just typing l to pull up local IP information, as seen below.

This allows us to do things like scan the network for other devices. This part of Ehtools Framework gives us better visibility on a network and situational awareness of what devices are around us. The various information can be broken down as follows:

> (ehtools)> if
 
    INFO: Runs ifconfig and gives the names and information 
    about all network devices.

> (ehtools)> 1

    INFO: Enable wlan0.
    (d1 disables it)

> (ehtools)> 2

    INFO: Enable wlan0mon.
    (d2 disables it)

> (ehtools)> 3    
   
    INFO: Randomize or set the MAC address to a specific value.

> (ehtools)> 7     

    INFO: View the public IP address your computer 
    is leaving on sites you visit.

> (ehtools)> 19    

    INFO: Look up the physical address of a given 
    IP address to determine it's relative location.

> (ehtools)> scan   

    INFO: Start an ARP scan on the network 
    to discover nearby devices.

> (ehtools)> start  
      
    INFO: Start monitor mode on the wireless network adapter.

> (ehtools)> stop

    INFO: Stop wireless monitor mode on the network adapter.

# Install new tools

![TOOLS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54115104/66775236-3d423900-eecc-11e9-92e4-1f327b6413a0.png)

Part of the fun of Ehtools Framework is how easy it is to add new tools to our arsenal. To demonstrate this, let's download Pupy, a Python-based RAT designed to take control of other computers on the network. We can select option 9 to access the list of tools in Ehtools Framework.

    INFO: Our framework has more than 100 packages in
    ehtools archive (on server this archive: 2.3 Tb)!

From the next menu, the tools are broken down into major categories, with options for managing the installation of scripts. The options presented are:

> 1) Wi-Fi tools (tools for attacking wireless networks).

    INFO: Wi-Fi options this is tools for attacking wireless
    networks and network databases.

> 2) Remote access (tools for getting remote access to other devices and remotely managing them).

    INFO: Remote access means tools for getting access to 
    other devices and remotely managing them.
    
> 3) Information gathering (collecting intelligence on people or website).

    INFO: Information gathering tools, tools for collecting
    intelligence on peaple or website.
    
> 4) Website tools (tools for exploiting or attacking sites).

    INFO: Website tools, tools for exploiting or attacking
    sites and network databases.
   
> 5) Other (a miscellaneous collection of other hacking tools)

    INFO: Other tools this is collection of miscellaneous
    hacking tools.

You can also manage your installed tools by accessing option 6. To download Pupy, we'll go to option 2, which is remote access. Here, we will see a list of different tools for remote access, and we can select option 3 for Pupy.

# Use ehtools quick access

    INFO: Ehtools quick access, this is when you run
    ehtools and for example ehtools -r to remove ehtools!
    
Run it to open quick access menu:

> ehtools -o

Run it to uninstall ehtools:

> ehtools -u

Run it to open handshake manu:

> ehtools -h

Run it to open Find WPS menu:

> ehtools -w

    INFO: For this shortcuts you will not need
    enter your ehtools password!

# Use ehtools application 

    INFO: Ehtools application is an Ehtools 
    Framework shortcut that allows users to 
    execute Ehtools Framework just selecting 
    ehtools in applications and clicking on it!

There are two ways how to setup ehtools application.

## Using the installer

    INFO: The ehtools INSTALLER allows 
    you to create ehtools application.

## Using the ehtapp

    INFO: There is an ehtools utility named 
    ehtapp (read more in Ehtools Utilities) that 
    allows users to configure ehtools application.

> ehtapp --create

# Why ehtools framework?

> More than 58 tools for pentesting installed by default

    INFO: More than 58 options installed by default you
    can find in ehtools, this is tools such as MetaSploit,
    WireShark and other tools!

> Password protection and config encryption

    INFO: In version 2.1.6 we added pasword protection,
    we added it for users who think that his/her friend or
    parents will turn into ehtools and will remove or destroy
    it. Only for this people we create password protection
    for Ehtools Framework :)

> Easy in learning and this is the best framework for beginners

    INFO: Ehtools Framework's TUI is very simple for beginners,
    you can start attack on the local network by choosing an
    option from main menu. It is very simple, is not it?

> UX/UI impruvements for beginners

    INFO: It uses the names you supply to connect to the tools 
    needed to execute any attacks you select! Aside from that 
    initial input, the majority of the possible attacks can be performed 
    merely by choosing the option number from the menu. This means you can 
    grab a network handshake or download a new hacking tool like Pupy by just 
    selecting from one of the menu options!

> More than 100 tools you can install from ehtools or ehtoolslite

    INFO: Bourne-again shell and Gnome-terminal shell needed
    for ehtools TUI and also without Gnome-terminall shell 
    modules such as (eht1, eht2 and etc.) will not work!

> Good Internet connection for server support (only ehtools PRO)

    INFO: The server support for ehtools PRO is one of system 
    requirements, it is needed for collect information about 
    ehtools crashes and it is also needed for check product 
    status such as (you bought ehtools/you did not buy ehtools)
